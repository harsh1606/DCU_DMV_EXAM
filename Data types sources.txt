06 Data Visualisation 
Communication 
Communication : Analyzing and Presenting  
Graphic Communication: Sender, medium , message, receiver  
Graphic Communication: Stages of Understanding 
• Sensing → your brain seeing colours and shapes 
• Perceiving → what does it show? big, small, bright, red,  
• Interpreting → what does it mean? increasing, smaller, good, bad 
• Comprehending → what does it mean to me? relevance, consequences 
Graphic Communication Goals 
• Information 
• Persuasion 
• Education 
• Entertainment 
Graphic communication, particularly through data visualization and management, aims to 
present complex information effectively by leveraging these core goals: 
1. Information 
• Purpose: Deliver clear, accurate, and concise data to the audience. 
• Use in Visualization: Charts, graphs, and dashboards help reveal trends, 
relationships, and comparisons at a glance. 
• Example: Real-time sales dashboards for tracking key performance indicators (KPIs). 
2. Persuasion 
• Purpose: Influence decisions or opinions using data-backed arguments. 
• Use in Visualization: Infographics and comparative visuals emphasize critical points 
to support a message. 
• Example: A graph showing environmental benefits of renewable energy over fossil 
fuels to advocate for policy changes. 
3. Education 
• Purpose: Enhance understanding of concepts or processes through accessible, 
structured content. 
• Use in Visualization: Interactive tools, flowcharts, and annotated diagrams simplify 
learning. 
• Example: Tutorials using step-by-step flowcharts for process improvement in 
business. 
4. Entertainment 
• Purpose: Engage audiences with visually appealing and fun representations of data. 
• Use in Visualization: Creative visuals, animations, or gamified charts make data 
more relatable. 
• Example: Interactive maps showing world populations in an engaging, user-driven 
way. 
Data visualization combines these goals to make information intuitive, actionable, and 
meaningful, driving better management and decision-making. 
Data Visualisation: Good Things to Know 
• Why visualise data? To explore and analyse  ,  To communicate 
• Good things to know  
• Pie charts  
Only for parts of a whole (ie, 100% divided into categories) • No more than 5 slices • Label carefully 
and clockwise, decreasing in size • Minimise user effort and never 3D effect 
• 3D  
• Area  
• Axes 
• Clutter  
• Good Visualisation? 
Data visualization II 
Chart types (https://www.atlassian.com/data/charts/essential-chart-types-for-data
visualization ) 
Categorical: comparing categories and distributions of quantitative values 
Hierarchical: Charting part-to-whole relationships and hierarchies 
Relational: Graphing relationships to explore correlations and connections 
Temporal: Showing trends and activities over time 
Spatial: Mapping spatial patterns through overlays and distortions
